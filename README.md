# Price oracles + signed messages on & off-chain

A presentation style dapp for ETHBerlin.

## Running these slides

Clone the project.

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Considerations

Needs a geth node running on http://localhost:8545 with at least 3 unlocked accounts with no password.

You can run `dapp testnet --accounts 3` and everything will magically work!

If you do not have our `dapptools`, install them using

`curl https://dapp.tools/install | sh`

or visit https://dapp.tools for more information.
